I came across [this post](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan/status/1343260278381633536) from @lara_hogan recently on Twitter and decided to reflect on how things went for Zinnfinity in 2020.

## 2020 was about...

I have been trying to grow revenues by at least 25% per year, and this year was no different. My aim was to find more stability in work by building new relationships with great clients and solidifying my existing clients.

I started contracting with Modern Tribe, one of the leading WordPress agencies, which has been a great boon for me as a developer, allowing me to learn from some truly great developers and improve the work I provide to my other clients.

COVID, of course. The advent of Covid meant trying to procure any work possible with so much uncertainty in how bad it would be. Of course, it turned out to be much worse and longer lasting than I could have imagined. I was fortunate, however, to maintain pretty steady work and income.

## What numbers were important this year?

Revenue and hours worked. I aimed for improving revenue by 25% (and actually increased by nearly 40%). I also wanted to improve my efficiency and accuracy in estimating projects. This is always a challenge, but I made a lot of headway this year in working more efficiently.

## What were the bummers/misses?

A big miss for me was my estimation on the largest project I have worked on this year. We were way off in the needs for it and in hindsight I wish we had spent more time up-front deciding the scope and requirements of the project before jumping into the work.

That being said, the client is great to work with and have been understanding and patient as we all work to completion. In the end we all want to produce a great product, and we continue to work toward that end.

## North stars/guiding ideas that emerged...

Thoughtfulness and planning. I'm convinced that spending time to talk about the goals of a project and what we are really trying to achieve is the most important part of any project. Taking that extra time to understand the requirements just makes everything much more focused and smooth.

## A mind blowing thing I learned this year was...

How quickly things can change. So often the world seems so immovable, and yet all it took was a tiny virus to completely disrupt our lives and utterly change the world we live in.

## A mistake I made that I learned from was...

This is much the same as the misses from earlier. I failed to properly understand some requirements up front and instead we plowed forward. But I learned a big lesson from this on project management and the order of work that should be done.

## I thought "this is a ridiculous gambit" when I took the risk to...

The project with the mistake I learned from was also a ridiculous gambit in some ways. By far the biggest project I have done to date, it was and still is a daunting task, especially for a small team. But, I have been really proud that we made it through the most challenging hurdles and there is light at the end of the tunnel.

## 2021 will be about...

I want to continue with the stability in work that I found this year, while improving even more as a developer. I also want to made inroads this year into building income through passive revenue sources from side projects.
