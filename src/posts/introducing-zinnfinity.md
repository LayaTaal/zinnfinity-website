As the world has grown and changed, a customer’s first introduction to a business has morphed to take advantage of new forms of communication. Today, the web is often a customer’s first introduction to a business, which makes it all the more important that businesses and organizations have compelling websites that immediately sell their brand.

I founded Zinnfinity Web Services in 2018 with the focus of delivering professional websites for small businesses that look great, run fast, and don’t break the bank. As we enter the second half of the year, and I launch the new iteration of Zinnfinity, I want to start sharing a little more about industry related topics that (hopefully) will be interesting for my clients and colleagues.

Before any of that though I’d like to introduce myself, talk about how I got to where I am now, and outline my goals for my clients and Zinnfinity.

## How I Ended up Here

I graduated in 2006 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Physics from Texas State University in San Marcos, TX. I begrudgingly left that (at the time) small central Texas town, with its amazing spring fed rivers and bike-riding culture, and accepted a job as a Data Analyst in the Houston oil industry. For ten years, I worked analyzing geophysical seismic data, transforming masses of squiggly lines into hi-resolution images used to locate oil and gas. The science of the work was extremely rewarding and challenging, but ultimately the industry was not for me.

In 2016 I left my job to take a year off. I spent that time diving into my passion for music, while also reviving my interest in web development, a hobby of mine since I was in junior high.
The Birth of Zinnfinity
As luck would have it, that same year several close friends of mine took the leap of starting their own businesses and needed help with their websites. Those were the first websites I built professionally, which allowed me to ease back into the web development world while also helping my friends get their business up and running at a great price.

After a few recommendations, I started to have regular requests for website work. It was about this point that I realized there was a demand for affordable small-business sites with thoughtful designs and well-constructed code. 

After two years, I decided it was time to launch the business, and Zinnfinity Web Services was born. My mission was (and still is), to be able to provide excellent websites and develop ongoing relationships with my clients, at an affordable price.

## Zinnfinity Today 

I now collaborate with a number of great designers and content writers, who allow me to focus on writing great code. 

The ability for me to focus more purely on development means I can spend more time learning the tools of my trade. While I continue to develop many websites on WordPress, I now provide my clients with other options in order to utilize some of the fantastic tools we have in the modern web-dev toolkit.  

Some of these new tools include static-site generators such as Jekyll, NextJS, and Gatsby. These platforms allow me to build websites that are served blazing fast to users across the globe. I’ve also begun incorporating React on certain projects. A powerful JavaScript framework geared toward User Interaction (UI), React makes creating dynamic interactive websites a joy for the developer and a beautiful experience for the user.

## To Zinnfinity and Beyond
One of my goals for the year ahead is to become an expert in data visualizations on the web, merging web development with the skills I honed over ten years analyzing and presenting seismic data to some of the largest and most successful companies in the world. This is a unique skill set which I intend to offer clients who may need this niche service.

I will also continue to stay on top of the latest trends and needs for websites as devices, browsers, and users grow and change. My highest priority is to be able to provide sound advice to my customers so that they can make informed business decisions. I see it as my job to be the expert on website, so that my customers can lean on me with confidence and assurance that they are getting the very best.

I look forward to the unknown challenges of the year ahead, and to building lasting relationships that bring success to my clients and to Zinnfinity.
